PH sensor:

Connections:
Common GND the circuit with GND Pin of ESP32.
Connect the GND pin of 9v DC battery to common GND.(NOT SURE IF IT WORKS THAT WAY I HAVE ONLY TRIED WITH ROOM 117 POWER SUPPLY)
Connect + of O/P pin to pin 36 of ESP32.
Connect - of O/P pin to GND.
Connect 9V+ pin to 9V DC battery pin.
COnnect 9V- pin to common GND.

Code:
const int potPin=36;
float ph;
float Value=0;
 
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(potPin,INPUT);
  delay(1000);
}
 void loop(){
 
    Value= analogRead(potPin);
    Serial.print(Value);
    Serial.print(" | ");
    float voltage=Value*(3.3/4095.0);
    ph=(3.3*voltage);
    Serial.println(ph);
    delay(1000);
 }
 
 Calibration-
 NOT DONE YET.
